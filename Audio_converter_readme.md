## How to Use

### Step 1: Prepare Your Chat Log

You need a Discord chat log in HTML format. The HTML should have this structure:

```html
<div class="message">
    <div class="message-username">John</div>
    <div class="message-text">Hello everyone!</div>
    <div class="message-timestamp">Today at 2:30 PM</div>
</div>
<div class="message">
    <div class="message-username">Sarah</div>
    <div class="message-text">Hey John! How's it going?</div>
    <div class="message-timestamp">Today at 2:31 PM</div>
</div>
```

**Getting Discord Chat Logs:**
- Use browser developer tools to copy HTML from Discord web
- Use Discord chat export tools/bots
- Manually create HTML following the format above

### Step 2: Run the Application

1. Start the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to the provided URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`)

### Step 3: Configure Settings

1. **Enter API Key**: In the sidebar, paste your ElevenLabs API key
2. **Upload Chat Log**: Click "Choose an HTML chat log file" and select your file
3. **Preview Messages**: Review the parsed messages to ensure correct formatting

### Step 4: Assign Voices

1. The app will detect all unique usernames from your chat
2. For each participant, select a voice from the dropdown menu
3. Available voices include:
   - **Rachel**: Friendly female voice
   - **Drew**: Casual male voice  
   - **Bella**: Young female voice
   - **Antoni**: Mature male voice
   - **Elli**: Emotional female voice
   - **Josh**: Deep male voice
   - **Arnold**: Older male voice
   - **Sam**: Neutral voice

### Step 5: Generate Audio

1. Review your voice assignments
2. Optionally enable "Add pauses between messages" for natural flow
3. Click "Generate Audio Transcript"
4. Wait for processing (time depends on chat length and API speed)
5. Download your audio file and listen!

## Configuration Options

### Advanced Settings

- **Add pauses between messages**: Adds natural breaks between different speakers
- **Voice stability**: Controls consistency vs. expressiveness (configured in code)
- **Similarity boost**: Controls voice similarity to original (configured in code)

### Customizing Voices

You can modify the `DEFAULT_VOICES` dictionary in the code to use different ElevenLabs voice IDs:

```python
DEFAULT_VOICES = {
    "Custom_Voice_Name": "your_voice_id_here",
    # Add more custom voices...
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No messages found in the uploaded file"**
- Check your HTML format matches the expected structure
- Ensure CSS classes are correct: `.message`, `.message-username`, `.message-text`

**"ElevenLabs API error"**
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check your ElevenLabs account quota/credits
- Ensure stable internet connection

**Audio quality issues**
- Try different voice models in ElevenLabs dashboard
- Adjust voice settings in the code
- Check input text for special characters

**Large file processing**
- For very long chats, consider splitting into smaller segments
- Monitor your ElevenLabs API usage limits

### Performance Tips

- **Optimize chat length**: Longer chats take more time and API credits
- **Use appropriate voices**: Match voice gender/age to participants for realism
- **Test with small files**: Start with short conversations to verify setup
